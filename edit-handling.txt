I suspect that the problem you mentioned can be fixed with more statements that will set the value of properties in a package of data that gets assembled in the “handle submit” method. Here’s the data flow sequence for the properties of an object:
1. When the edit component loads, the current (old) object values are fetched 
2. They are saved in state variables (so they can participate in the useful data binding) 
3. The user updates one or more properties  
4. When the save/submit task starts, a new object is created, using the values in state 
5. That object is sent
