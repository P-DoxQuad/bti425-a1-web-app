                            <p>Hello, my name is Michael. I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. I am a 2016 CPD graduate from Seneca College, and currently enrolled in BSD.</p>

                            <p>My passion for technology began at a very young age. I saw the digital world as being inclusive of everyone despite differences of abilities. With so much ingenuity and possibilities to explore, I took the initiative to learn as much as I could on my own with Hardware and Software since these areas could not be held back by my disability. 14 years and counting, I have developed a wealth of knowledge in various areas.</p>

                            <p>In my spare time I like to code. It really isn’t a job. Some of the most satisfying moments are when you code something that actually works! I also enjoy reading Tech articles; always looking for cool things to play with that I can get a hold of. When I need more of a break from the world, you’ll either catch me on Netflix, Youtube, or playing a video game. My Top 5 All-Time Favourite PC Games are Half Life 2 (Entire Saga), Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Command and Conquer Tiberium Wars, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.</p>

                            <p>I like to eat chicken. If you need a project done, bring me a junior chicken sandwich and we'll talk... I'll accept a box of Kraft Dinner too as an alternative.”</p>
